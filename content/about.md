Hi everyone, this is Tarun Jana. I am a passionate coder from India. My area of interest is C, C++, and object-oriented programming.

The fun fact is: I don't have a computer science degree. I have completed my masters' in Applied Mathematics. But I am more interested in coding than Mathematics.

This blog is a place for me and for my alter ego. I'll try to share my experiences through this blog. From programming to technology to life, everything will be catered through blog posts.

Any suggestions or constructive criticism is always welcomed. To get in touch with me, follow [this link](/contact).
