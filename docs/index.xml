      <description>I needed a blog for myself. My requirements were pretty straight-forward: A static site generator with flexibility and speed.
I had a little bit of experience with Jekyll. Since I was not familiar with the Ruby programming language, it was quite overwhelming for me. I could go with Gatsby, Next, Gridsome, 11ty, and all these SSG written in JavaScript. But again, I was not a JavaScript developer to deal with these.</description>

      <description>The man whom I see everyday&amp;hellip; in the mirror!
  Hi everyone, this is Tarun Jana. I am a passionate coder from India. My area of interest is C, C++, and object-oriented programming.
The fun fact is: I don&amp;rsquo;t have a computer science degree. I have completed my masters&#39; in Applied Mathematics. But I am more interested in coding than Mathematics.
This blog is a place for me and for my alter ego.</description>
