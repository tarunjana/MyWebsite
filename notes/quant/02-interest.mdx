## Introduction

Simple interest is just an AP (Arithmetic Progression).

Suppose the rate of interest is $10\%$

The principal and the amount after certain times are shown below:

| Principle |  $1$ Year  |  $2$ Year  |  $3$ Year  |
| :---:     |  :---:     |  :---:     |  :---:     |
| $1000$    |  $1100$    |  $1200$    |  $1300$    |

Compound interest is just a GP (Geometric Progression).

Suppose the rate of interest is $10\%$

The principal and the amount after certain times are shown below:

| Principle |  $1$ Year            |  $2$ Year             |  $3$ Year              |
| :---:     |  :---:               |  :---:                |  :---:                 |
| $1000$    |  $1000\times 1.1$    |  $1000\times 1.1^2$   |  $1000\times 1.1^3$    |

## Total Rate of Interest

Suppose the principal $(P)=1000$ and the rate of interest $(R)=10\%$

### Simple Interest

The total rate of interest for two years is : $10\%+10\%=20\%$

:::info Formula
If the rate of interest for the first year is $a\%$ and that of the second year is $b\%$, the total rate of 
simple interest for two years is : $(a+b)\%$
:::

### Compound Interest

The total rate of interest for two years is : $\left(10+10+\dfrac{10\times 10}{100}\right)\%=21\%$

:::tip Formula
If the rate of interest for the first year is $a\%$ and that of the second year is $b\%$, the total rate of 
compound interest for two years is : $\left(a+b+\dfrac{a\times b}{100}\right)\%$

## Compound Interest Calculation

Suppose $P=1000$, $R=10\%$ and $T=3$

Multiplying factor : $\dfrac{11}{10}\times\dfrac{11}{10}\times\dfrac{11}{10}=\dfrac{1331}{1000}$

Amount after $3$ years : $1000\times\dfrac{1331}{1000}=1331$

Compound interest after $3$ years : $1000\times\dfrac{1331-1000}{1000}=1000\times\dfrac{331}{1000}=331$

## Difference Between SI & CI

### After 2 Years

Suppose $P=1000$, $R=10\%$ and $T=2$

Total rate of simple interest for two years : $(10+10)\%=20\%$

Total rate of compound interest for two years : $\left(10+10+\dfrac{10\times 10}{100}\right)\%=21\%$

Difference between the above two rate of ineterests : $21\%-20\%=1\%$

Therefore the difference between SI and CI after two years is : $(1000\times 1\%)=10$

:::tip
$\boxed{P}\xrightarrow{R\%}\boxed{I}\xrightarrow{R\%}\boxed{D}$

Where $P=$ principal, $R=$ rate of interest, $I=$ simple interest after $1$ year and $D=$ difference between 
SI and CI after $2$ 
years.

The difference between SI and CI after $2$ years $=$ Interest of simple interest after $1$ year.

### After 2 Years

:::note Formula
Difference between SI and CI after $3$ years is : $3P\left(\dfrac{R}{100}\right)^2+P\left(\dfrac{R}{100}\right)^3$

Where the notations have their usual meanings.

## Installments

Suppose principal $=P$, rate of interest $=R\%$, time $=n$ years and annual installments $=x$

### Simple Interest

The equation for installments is : $nx+\dfrac{xR}{100}[(n-1)+(n-2)+\cdots +3+2+1]=\textmd{Amount after n years}$

---

### Compound Interest

The equation for installments is : $x\left(\dfrac{100+R}{100}\right)^{n-1}+x\left(\dfrac{100+R}{100}\right)^{n-2}+\cdots+x\left(\dfrac{100+R}{100}\right)+x=\textmd{Amount after n years}$
